For this app, you can use the existing image in the learningpal_api_test for testing.
To test the api, make sure you installed the python2.7 and dependency requests and json, you can use pip install requests pip install json to install the package if you don't have them.
Run python image_sender.py then the image will be sent to api, results will come up after seconds.
If you want to change the image for testing, please replace the IMG_NAME in image_sender.py to the image that you put in the same directory.
