This repository includes:
  1. Handwritten math equation recognition API
 Â 2. Math equation detection in a single image API
  3. Using above two API to achieve problem sheet auto grading

## For usage of Handwritten math equation recognition API
You can use provided image to test.
If you want to change the image for testing, please replace the IMG_NAME in image_sender.py to the image that you put in the same directory.

### Dependency
```
pip install requests

```
python image_sender.py 
```
###### Output:
```
u'{"confidence": 0.9945661408039893, "isResult": "true", "result": "( 3 - x ) ( x - 2 ) = 0 "}'
```

Replace handwritten images as you like

note: image resize to height of 50 pixs is recommended
